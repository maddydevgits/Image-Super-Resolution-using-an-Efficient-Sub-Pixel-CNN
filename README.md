# About Project
ESPCN (Efficient Sub-Pixel CNN), proposed by Shi, 2016 is a model that reconstructs a high-resolution version of an image given a low-resolution version. It leverages efficient "sub-pixel convolution" layers, which learns an array of image upscaling filters.

<br/>
In this code example, we will implement the model from the paper and train it on a small dataset, BSDS500.
